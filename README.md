# Sales_Analytics
Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing a company's sales data to provide key insights into top-performing products, customers, and regions. The data was extracted from a MySQL database, transformed, and loaded into Power BI for visualization. The project follows an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow to clean and prepare the data for analysis, resulting in an interactive dashboard that highlights important metrics like the top 5 states, top 5 products, and top 5 customer companies.

Purpose:
The main objective of this project is to perform data analysis on the company's sales data to provide actionable insights for business decision-making. By leveraging MySQL and Power BI, the project aims to extract valuable information that can drive strategic planning and optimize sales performance.

Workflow
ETL Process

    Extract: Sales data was extracted from the MySQL database using queries to pull relevant information on transactions, amounts, customers, and states.
    Transform: The data was cleaned, formatted, and transformed within Power BI to ensure consistency and accuracy. This included handling missing values, filtering unnecessary data, and creating calculated fields.
    Load: The cleaned and transformed data was loaded into Power BI, where it was used to build the dashboard.

MySQL Queries

To verify and extract data, various SQL queries were executed, such as:

    Querying transaction details for specific periods or regions.
    Checking the data for inconsistencies or missing information.
    Aggregating sales figures based on state, product, or customer.

Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard was designed in Power BI to visualize the results of the analysis. Key features include:

    Top 5 States: A visual representation of the states with the highest sales.
    Top 5 Products: Insights into the products that generate the most revenue.
    Top 5 Customer Companies: Identifying the companies contributing the most to the sales.
    Filters and Slicers: Interactive elements that allow users to explore the data based on specific criteria such as time, location, and product categories.

Tools and Technologies

    MySQL: Used to store and query the raw sales data.
    Power BI: Used for data transformation, loading, and dashboard creation.
    ETL Process: Extracted data from MySQL, transformed and cleaned it in Power BI, and then loaded it for visualization.
This project demonstrates the use of ETL processes and powerful data visualization tools like Power BI to turn raw sales data into actionable insights. The final dashboard provides a clear and concise view of the company's sales performance, enabling data-driven decision-making.
